  <h1>About</h1>
</div>

<section class="about-intro">
  <p>I'm a technical architect who turns complex business challenges into working solutions. Based in Denver, I've spent the past 12+ years building systems that scaleâ€”from 900-agent call centers to government platforms serving half a million citizens.</p>

  <p>My approach is simple: understand the problem, design the right solution, and execute relentlessly. Whether it's architecting a partner relationship management system for USAID or reducing call center disposition time by 20%, I focus on outcomes that matter.</p>

  <h2>Beyond the Code</h2>
  <p>When I'm not architecting systems, you'll find me on Colorado's gravel roads, pushing miles on my bike. I'm passionate about music (guitar player for 20+ years), lifting, and understanding market dynamics. I volunteer with Volunteers for Outdoor Colorado, helping maintain the trails that make this state special.</p>
